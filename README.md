## Monitor program

The *ncurses* TUI (*Terminal User Interface*) will give better results using 
The "Meslo LG L for Powerline" font that should already be installed on your
system. The font can also be downloaded at [https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

Here is what you should see by running "`bin/monitor`" from the root of your 
project, once you will have implemented the shared memory ("`memory_t`" 
structure).

## Design patterns

Some patterns are included and could be used in the project (see in [src/pattern_examples](src/pattern_examples)).

More useful information about patterns can be found in RÃ©gis Clouard's [course](https://foad.ensicaen.fr/course/view.php?id=62) and also [here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/examples).
